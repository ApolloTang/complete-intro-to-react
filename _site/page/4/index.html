    One of the most compelling reason to use redux is its amazing debugging experience. redux has the <em>fantastic</em> ability to do time-traveling debugging, meaning you can step forwards and backwards through actions you&apos;ve dispatched. It&apos;s really powerful for debugging.

    So we broke all of our tests. They all fail now. High five! This is a big reason why I&apos;m hesitant to test UI code: I find my tests break all the time just because I&apos;m rewriting markup or other code. Nonetheless, let&apos;s refix our tests and add two for Redux. As opposed to testing React which I don&apos;t do much of, I test the hell out of my Redux code. Redux code is very testable by design and you should cover all or nearly-all of your reducers with tests.

    Universal rendering, or the artist formerly known as isomorphic rendering. The idea here is that you server-side prerender your code so that when it gets down to the client, your browser can <strong>instantly</strong> show the markup while your app bootstraps in the background. It makes everything feel very instantaneous.

    So far all of our routing with react-router has synchronous which makes sense. When we detect that a user has requested a route, we already have that route in our bundle.js and we render and serve that to them. The logic follows.

    So this is a React work, why the &#x1F4A9; are we talking about [Preact][preact]? Let me tell you why! Preact is amazing! Preact is an <em>almost</em> drop in replacement for React that is  <strong>much</strong> smaller in file size while maintaing nearly all the features and actually being faster (or so my limited, flawed benchmarking leads me to believe.) One thing is for sure though, it&apos;s much smaller!
