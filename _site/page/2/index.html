    We have been writing our React with vanilla JavaScript up until now which frankly few people do. Most people take advantage of JSX which essentially adds HTML/XML-like syntax as a &quot;primitive&quot; type to JavaScript. In reality, what it does it takes the HTML you write for your components and translate them into the same calls we writing just using vanilla JavaScript.

    So let&apos;s actually discuss what we&apos;re going to build today: a basic Netflix experience. This is going to afford us several fun experiences and use cases to explore with our new-found stack. Our app is going to have a home page, a browse/search page, and a video page. Over the next few chapters we are going to be talking about redux and react-router and their rather-central roles to the React eco-system. But first let&apos;s keep diving into React.

    So now we have a basic landing page and we want to be able to transition to another page. Because we making this as a single page app, we are going to use the marvelous <a href="https://react-router.now.sh">react-router</a>. react-router is a robust piece of technology and we are just going to be scratching the surface of it now. If you intend on making a single page app, I suggest you deep dive into it to uncover all of its potential.

    Let&apos;s start making our search page. We&apos;re going to start with some dummy data and work our way from there. Again, follow the same HTML structure and CSS naming as me and you&apos;ll get all the styling for free. Feel free to take a glance at public/data.json to see what&apos;s there. As you may have guessed, it&apos;s a bunch of Netflix shows. This whole workshop is actually just an elaborate advertisement for Netflix (just kidding; I promise.)

    We&apos;ve discussed props which all you to have immutable state passed from parents to children. However, as any seasoned UI developer will point out, user interfaces are inherently stateful. You app at some level must contain some level of mutability. React gives you a very controlled window to introduce this mutability to be able to reason easily about this mutability aptly called state.
